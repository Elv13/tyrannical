Tyranic - A simple rule engine
------------------------------

### Description
Shifty was great and served us well since the early days of the Awesome 3.\* series, but just as
many kid aged TV stars, it havn't grown that well. Many of it's, once unique, features are now
supported by the default awful.tag engine, adding legacy complexity to the code base and affecting
performance.

This is why Tyranic was created. It is a light rule engine offering pretty much the same rule system,
but without all the dynamic tag code. Note that dynamic tagging is now supported directly by awesome.

### Examples

Install [Xephyr](http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/Xephyr) and run the following script

 sh utils/xephyr.sh start

*Note:* The tyranical repository must be named awesome-tyranical for the script to work out of the box.

Also see samples.rc.lua for a sample.
